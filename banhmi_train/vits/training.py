"""PyTorch Lightning training loop for the single-speaker VITS model.

Single-speaker is not a runtime option here: banhmi_train.preprocess's
config.json has no `num_speakers`/`speaker_id_map` fields at all (removed
since this project permanently targets single-speaker LJSpeech), so
n_speakers=1 / gin_channels=0 are hardcoded rather than read from anywhere
-- there is no other value they could ever take.

        Phoneme-id count was tried first as a bucketing key (cheap: already

        14.2 samples/s (bucketed) vs 37.8 (unbucketed), both with
        cudnn.benchmark=True. Root cause: phoneme count only stabilizes
        TextEncoder/StochasticDurationPredictor shapes. The PosteriorEncoder
        (a 16-layer WaveNet -- the single largest non-Generator compute
        block) and flow run on the *full* spectrogram/latent length before
        SynthesizerTrn.forward() crops a fixed segment_size window out of it;
        phoneme count is too weak a proxy for spectrogram length (different
        speaking rates, pauses, etc.) to stabilize that shape. Loading each
        cached .spec.pt just for its frame count (matches banhmi_tts's own
        LengthBucketBatchSampler, which buckets by spectrogram_lengths) is a
        one-time cost at dataloader setup -- EXCEPT it isn't quite one-time

        every DDP rank, so with a full 13,100-utterance dataset (12,500
        after held-out val/test) this took long enough (~13 min, ~14GB of
        .spec.pt reads per rank -- confirmed via /proc/<pid>/io) and drifted
        enough between ranks that NCCL's collective-op watchdog aborted with
        SIGABRT before both ranks reached the same barrier. Caching to a
        JSON file next to dataset.jsonl fixes the repeat-run cost; a cache
        pre-warmed by a quick single-process pass before launching the real
        multi-rank job avoids the first-run rank skew entirely (see

        This is the safety net `torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler` provides for free
        under fp16 (check for inf/NaN, skip the step, carry on) and which
        bf16 training silently does without, since bf16 needs no loss scaling
        and therefore gets no scaler. Without it, one non-finite gradient is
        permanent: AdamW writes NaN into the parameters, and every subsequent
        forward pass through those parameters is NaN forever after. That is
        exactly how StochasticDurationPredictor kept dying here -- and because
        dp's gradients don't reach dec/enc_p, loss_mel went on improving and
        hid the damage for hundreds of epochs.

        Skipping costs one finite-check per parameter per step and throws away
        only the genuinely broken batch; the parameters keep their last good
        values and training continues from there.

        Under DDP this stays consistent across ranks without extra
        synchronisation: gradients are all-reduced during backward, and a NaN
        on any rank propagates through that averaging, so every rank sees the
