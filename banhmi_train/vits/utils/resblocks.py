    the whole block, replacing ResBlock1/ResBlock2's parallel dilated-conv
    branches entirely (one block per stage, not multiple summed branches).

    Two deliberate departures from the two blocks above, both novel to
    this direction (not MarGan): weight_norm instead of MobileNetV2's
    BatchNorm (matches every other conv in this Generator, and avoids
    BatchNorm's batch-size sensitivity during GAN training), and the
    project's own SnakeBeta instead of ReLU6.

    Linear bottleneck (MobileNetV2's own term): the last pointwise conv
    has NO activation after it -- the paper's finding that nonlinearities
    destroy information when applied to an already-projected-down (here:
    back to `channels`, not the expanded `channels*expansion`) representation.
