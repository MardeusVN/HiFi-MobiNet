# Limits which espeak-ng dictionaries get compiled, applied as a
# PATCH_COMMAND on the downloaded espeak-ng source before it's built.
#
# espeak-ng's cmake/data.cmake unconditionally does:
#   list(APPEND _dict_compile_list af am an ar ... vi ... yue)   # all ~120
# Overriding the variable right before it's consumed (just before the
# _mbrola_lang_list block, a stable unique anchor) replaces that list with
# only the languages this fork needs, so the (slow) per-language dictionary
# compile step only runs for those.
#
# Usage: cmake -DTARGET_FILE=<path to cmake/data.cmake> -DLANGS=en,vi -P patch_espeak_langs.cmake
# LANGS is comma-separated (not a CMake list) -- see CMakeLists.txt for why.
